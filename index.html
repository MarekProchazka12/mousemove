            <h2>We can save the<br><span> Seas</span></h2>
            <p>Two american youtubers Mr Beast and Mark Rober started this fundraiser project as a follow up to their previous project #TeamTrees where they planted a tree for every dollar donated.
                Team trees was very popular and raised 23 milion dollars with big celebrities like Elon Musk contributing to the project. It has been 2 years since #TeamTrees so now their trying to
                have the same effect with #TeamSeas. The idea is that for every dollar donated 1 pound (0.45 kg) of trash will be removed from rivers, seas, oceans etc. You can help too by clickin the link below or just spreading the message.
                Lets make this world a bit better once again. #TEAMSEAS
